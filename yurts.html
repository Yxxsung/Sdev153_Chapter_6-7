                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor,
                a roof fome that can be opened, and a private deck.

                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It also helps
                to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
