            a roof fome that can be opened, and a private deck.</p></section>

                </strong>
            </h3>


            <p>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-sized bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs, fridge,
            microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and

            </h3>


            <p>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It also helps
            to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</p></section>
